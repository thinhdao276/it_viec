### 🎯 Business Objective
**Requirement 2:** Build a machine learning system to predict whether to recommend a company based on:
- Text analysis of employee reviews (from "What I liked" column)
- Company clustering patterns  
- Rating gap analysis vs market average

### 🔬 New Methodology: Clustering + Rating Gap Analysis

#### ❌ **Old Approach (Similarity-based):**
- Created similarity scores between company pairs
- Used TF-IDF on full text descriptions  
- Target based on similarity threshold
- **Risk:** Recommended similar companies, not necessarily good ones

#### ✅ **New Approach (Performance-based):**
- **Only uses "What I liked" column** for text analysis
- **Company clustering** to group similar companies
- **Rating gaps** compared to market average
- **Target based on actual performance** of companies
- **Value:** Recommends objectively better companies

### 🔧 Key Innovation: Rating Gap Analysis
Measuring how companies perform relative to market benchmarks across:
- **Rating Gap**: Overall rating vs market average
- **Salary & Benefits Gap**: vs market average
- **Culture & Fun Gap**: vs market average  
- **Training & Learning Gap**: vs market average
- **Management Care Gap**: vs market average
- **Office & Workspace Gap**: vs market average
